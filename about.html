            <p>Hello traveler. My name is <b>Aveline Villaganas</b> and I'm an aspiring developer. I recently graduated from the <b>California State University - Long Beach</b> majoring in <b>Computer Science</b>. During my academic career I have developed a passion for coding and looking into new technologies. I have experience with web development - HTML/CSS, JavaScript - and I want to dive deeper into full-stack development. Beyond my small projects I am fascinated with machine learning, its various training methods and how it can be used in industy. </p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy experimenting with my personal projects and exploring different disciplines under the umbrella of Computer Science. I am currently on the lookout for opportunities that will allow me to collaborate, learn and grow in a professional tech industry.</p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>For me what led me down the path of AI and machine learning was my <b>internship at Epson</b>. My mentor was interested in machine learning and wanted me to create a prototype chat bot using only open source resources. We worked in collaboration and his insight filled in some of the gaps in my own research. </p> 
            <p>This interest had me take a machine learning class the following semester learning more about what happens behind the open source models I was using. Since I have graduated I have reflected in what I want to pursue and came back to Huggingface - a huge source of knowledge for my past projects. Huggingface coupled with online influences like AI Warehouse sparked my pursuit in understanding reinforcement learning and seeking out opportunities where I can learn more about machine learning in a professional environment. One of my lastest achievements is my completed certification in reinforcement learning by Huggingface as I've recognized it as a start for what I can do.</p>

            <p>I couldn't make an about section of this website without talking about some of my hobbies! Coding can be fun and all but I do do other things. I highly enjoy model making with origami - particularly following Jo Nakashima for his wonderful video tutorials as well as Joseph Hwang for his book "Marine Origami" for intermediate and advanced models. </p>
            <p>When I need a break I also love to read and looking into books recommended to me. I am on a journey to go through various genres as I've hopped from thriller to murder mystery to sci-fi to high fantasy. I find myself intrigued by solid world building and seeing what inspired the author into crafting their world and the characters within it. </p>
